Given the table schemas below, write a query to print the company_code, founder name, total number of lead managers, total number of senior managers, total number of managers, and total number of employees. Order your output by ascending company_code.

Employee table (aliased as e) and the Company table (aliased as c)

SELECT
    e.company_code,
    MAX(founder),
    COUNT(DISTINCT lead_manager_code),
    COUNT(DISTINCT senior_manager_code),
    COUNT(DISTINCT manager_code),
    COUNT(DISTINCT employee_code)
FROM Employee e
LEFT JOIN 
Company c
ON e.company_code = c.company_code
GROUP BY e.company_code
ORDER BY e.company_code;
